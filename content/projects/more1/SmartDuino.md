This is an Open Source Project that aims to provide a Smart Sensor Hub with an extremely intuitive user interface using gestures and OLED Display. It flaunts amazing features like:

- OLED Module for high contrast and low power consumption Display Interface.
- Air Gestures to control music playback and volume (No more BUTTONS!)
- Air Humidity and Temperature Sensing.
- Fun Games using motion detection.
- BLE for low power wireless connectivity with your smartphone.
