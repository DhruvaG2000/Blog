I have contributed to open source in the following places:

- Writing a blog for SRA VJTI: [gdb-for-noobs PR#1](https://github.com/SRA-VJTI/blog/pull/1).
- Added instructions for using an ADC library for UncleRus/esp-idf-lib in [PR#163](https://github.com/UncleRus/esp-idf-lib/pull/163).
- Tried to add librobotcontrol support to the BeagleBone AI in [PR#204](https://github.com/beagleboard/librobotcontrol/pull/204).
- Added a device tree overlay for the audio cape on the BeagleBone AI using the Cape Compatiblity layer and merged to the official BeagleBoard-Device Trees repo in [PR#33](https://github.com/beagleboard/BeagleBoard-DeviceTrees/pull/33).
- Fixed [issue#34](https://github.com/beagleboard/BeagleBoard-DeviceTrees/issues/34) in the audio overlay for the BBAI that was causing a minor offset in the output audio frequency in [PR#36](https://github.com/beagleboard/BeagleBoard-DeviceTrees/pull/36).
- Added dependency and updated README in PRUDebug in [PR#1](https://github.com/giuliomoro/prudebug/pull/1).
- Ported PRUDebug used by Mark Yoder in his tutorials. It was merged by him to his repo in [PR#7](https://github.com/MarkAYoder/BeagleBoard-exercises/pull/7)
- Ported Prudebug having the `j` instruction in [PR#2](https://github.com/giuliomoro/prudebug/pull/2) in `giuliomoro/prudebug`
- Created the [BBAI-BELA Overlay to support the BELA Cape on BBAI using the Cape Compatibility Layer](https://github.com/DhruvaG2000/BeagleBoard-DeviceTrees/blob/v4.19.x-ti-overlays/src/arm/overlays/BBAI-BELA-00A1.dts).
- Created PruManager.cpp and PruManager.h to help port the Bela Code to AM572x and also provide backward compatibility under a single roof. [click here](https://github.com/giuliomoro/Bela-dhruva/pull/1)
