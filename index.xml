Writing a blog for SRA VJTI: gdb-for-noobs PR#1. Added instructions for using an ADC library for UncleRus/esp-idf-lib in PR#163. Tried to add librobotcontrol support to the BeagleBone AI in PR#204. Added a device tree overlay for the audio cape on the BeagleBone AI using the Cape Compatiblity layer and merged to the official BeagleBoard-Device Trees repo in PR#33. Fixed issue#34 in the audio overlay for the BBAI that was causing a minor offset in the output audio frequency in PR#36.</description></item><item><title>GDB</title><link>https://dhruvagole.tech/blogs/gdb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dhruvagole.tech/blogs/gdb/</guid><description>GDB for Noobs
Why use a debugger? Most of us tend to have bugs in our code. We could use printing commands to test our code, or we could use a debugger. Many times our code might seem to work correctly, because we didn&amp;rsquo;t test it under enough scenarios. Other times we know there&amp;rsquo;s a bug, but by just reading the code we don&amp;rsquo;t notice it is there. Thus, we should develop a habit of launching a debugger when we get into trouble.</description></item><item><title>GSoC2021</title><link>https://dhruvagole.tech/blogs/gsoc21/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dhruvagole.tech/blogs/gsoc21/</guid><description>GSoC2021: Bela support for BeagleBone AI
Bela is a hardware and software system for creating beautiful interaction with sensors and sound. This project proposes to provide restructuring and improvement of existing Bela Software Code to allow for compatibility and easier transition to newer TI chips (like in the BBAI).</description></item><item><title>Internships</title><link>https://dhruvagole.tech/projects/internships/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dhruvagole.tech/projects/internships/</guid><description>Augmented Labs Finemen India Made a working prototype of an LTE based data logger using MQTT protocol which enables remoteIoT applications for customers Hardware components used were the Microcontroller ESP32, SIMCOM7600 and ADS1115 ADC. C programming and communication protocols (ie. I2C, UART, etc.) were applied and the ESP-IDFframework was used to develop firmware for ESP32.
