Writing a blog for SRA VJTI: gdb-for-noobs PR#1. Added instructions for using an ADC library for UncleRus/esp-idf-lib in PR#163. Tried to add librobotcontrol support to the BeagleBone AI in PR#204. Added a device tree overlay for the audio cape on the BeagleBone AI using the Cape Compatiblity layer and merged to the official BeagleBoard-Device Trees repo in PR#33. Fixed issue#34 in the audio overlay for the BBAI that was causing a minor offset in the output audio frequency in PR#36.</description></item><item><title>GSoC2021</title><link>https://dhruvagole.tech/projects/opensource/gsoc21/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dhruvagole.tech/projects/opensource/gsoc21/</guid><description>GSoC2021: Bela support for BeagleBone AI
Bela is a hardware and software system for creating beautiful interaction with sensors and sound. This project proposes to provide restructuring and improvement of existing Bela Software Code to allow for compatibility and easier transition to newer TI chips (like in the BBAI).
The achieved milestons this project can be found on my official gsoc project report</description></item></channel></rss>
